This Python script focuses on creating a simple content player with user input options for music, videos, and movies. The script begins by displaying a menu using the Colorama library, allowing the user to choose between music, videos, or movies. After the user inputs their choice, the script checks the selection and proceeds accordingly. In the case of music, the script lists the available songs from a specified directory and prompts the user to select a track number to play. The selected music file is played using the os.startfile function. Similarly, for videos and movies, the script follows a similar pattern, listing the available files and allowing the user to choose a track for playback.

It's worth noting that the script utilizes the Colorama library to add color to the console output, making the interface more visually appealing. Additionally, the user is prompted to input a track number, and the chosen file is opened using the os.startfile function, providing a straightforward way to play content. Lastly, the script includes error handling, displaying a message in case of an incorrect input. Overall, this script provides a basic yet functional content player for music, videos, and movies with a user-friendly interface.
